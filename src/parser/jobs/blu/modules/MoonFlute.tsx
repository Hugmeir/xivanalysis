// Some notes on the expected GCD count.
// Waxing Nocturne is 15 seconds, so that seems like
// it should be 6 GCDs, but the first .5 seconds you are still
// in GCD recast time, so it's more like 14.5 seconds.
//
// If you are running very high spell speed, it is actually
// possible to get those 6 GCDs, but that's not the entire story!
//
// If you just cats Moon Flute and then do 6 GCDs, then no matter
// how strong those GCDs are -- even if they are 6 Revenge Blasts --
// it will be a potency loss compared to 6 Revenge Blasts + 6 Sonic Booms.
//
// So while GCDs are as usual important, the big deal in a Moon Flute
// window is weaving in as many oGCDs as we can *without* dropping a
// GCD cast.
//
// And so our standard moon flute window actually only has us cast 4
// GCDs (Triple Trident, The Rose of Destruction, Bristle, Matra Magic)
// while giving up ~5 seconds to purposely clipping with oGCDs;
// 3.6 seconds of Surpanakha, and the rest is all hard clips and
// purposeful multi-weaves.
//
// ...but for implementation details, Phantom Flurry is marked as a GCD,
// so even though we technically only do 4 GCDs in the window, we are
// looking for a pseudo-5th, Phantom Flurry.
